# Hy-run

Repository for project on UHS

Hello there!

As you can see, you have all the base code to run OSeMOSYS for "Utopia". The main idea is to change Utopia to the name of the country we are going to work on, and then to model first the actual energy system. 

There is already the .gms file to also include renewable, as well as one dedicated to Hydrogen, which is missing anyway many parts, like Steam Reforming + CCS, pipelines repowering and others that I hope we will find out. 

Until we meet again, try to get acquainted to the structure of the code.

In God we trust. Amen.
